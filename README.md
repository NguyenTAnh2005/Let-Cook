## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me:

- Build a complete Android application using Java
- Work with SQLite database directly using raw SQL
- Implement CRUD operations in a mobile environment
- Design user interfaces using XML
- Handle activity navigation and data passing
- Collaborate in a small development team

## ⚠ Limitations

- Images were stored locally inside the `drawable` folder instead of dynamic storage
- Image updates were not fully implemented
- Admin features were limited to food management (account management was not completed)
- No cloud backend or remote database

These limitations reflect the early stage of my mobile development journey and provided valuable learning experience.
